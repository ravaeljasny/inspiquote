## Why

First, let's talk about my motivation: I created this project as an attempt of trying something new than typical Frontend Development, and also, of applying good practices, not just about Writing Code, but also with Versioning, Documentation, Tests, Project Management, Containerization and other Good Practices applied in production-grade apps..

To be honest, I know almost nothing about Go, but I had some hobby experience mostly with Web Dev (JavaScript and friends). I decided to do something different, that will give me some fun. I asked ChatGPT about project ideas for Golang CLIs with PublicAPis and it told me about ZenQuotes, an API for listing citations by people born in this world. Thought for a while and realized it's a great idea, because I'm a self-improvement enthusiast, so that made me interested in making app based on API about quotes.

### Reasons for Golang

In short: scalable, simple, but powerful language. Good for CLIs development, great community and tooling.

What convinced me is the syntax, style of language.. I know it's just a tool, but who wants to learn a language without having fun?! (That's just my opinion, yours might be different, I understand).
